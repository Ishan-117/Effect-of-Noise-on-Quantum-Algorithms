# Effect-of-Noise-on-Quantum-Algorithms

This repository contains the final project submission for the course Introduction to Quantum Computer Science, undertaken in the fourth year of my undergraduate studies. The course provided a foundational understanding of quantum computing principles, quantum circuits, and algorithms, and this project demonstrates the application of those concepts through a practical implementation.

üìò Project Overview
The project explores fundamental ideas in quantum computing by simulating quantum circuits and analyzing their behavior using classical tools. The notebook includes:

An overview of key quantum computing concepts relevant to the project

Construction and simulation of quantum circuits

Implementation of basic quantum algorithms (e.g., superposition, entanglement, interference)

Visualization and analysis of measurement results

‚öõÔ∏è This notebook serves as a hands-on demonstration of how quantum information is manipulated and measured using standard frameworks available for quantum simulation.
